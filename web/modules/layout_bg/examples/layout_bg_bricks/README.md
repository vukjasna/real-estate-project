INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a module to demonstrate how you might create your own
custom module that leverages layout_bg in order to create a new
layout with a  background region. The layout_bg module only provides
two layouts, but new ones are easy to create. In this module
we add a background region to the twocol_bricks layout defined
in layout_discovery.

This module does not provide any code to demonstrate the visual
result of the new layout. The main goal is to give you a module that
you can copy off of without having any distractions.

There are four files in the module (other than readme and .info):
1. .layouts.yml
2. .libraries.yml
3. A simple layout plugin at src/Plugin/Layout

Each of these files has comments explaining what's happening.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
None.

RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------
None.

INSTALLATION
------------
This is intended to be a code example rather than something you need
to install. It's a totally fine layout, though, if you want to install
it. There's no tests for it, but it is a straightforward extension
of highly tested code.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
None.
