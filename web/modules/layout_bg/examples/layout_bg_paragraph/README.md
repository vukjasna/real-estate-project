INTRODUCTION
------------
Check out the "Paragraph with BG" paragraph type.
This modules demonstrates how one could use the Layout BG module to easily
configure a Paragraph type that can have an image or a video in the 
background. The Contenet (i.e. foreground) field can accept any number of 
any Paragraph types that exist on the site.

Feel free to use this module on your site. It's provided primarily as an
example, however, and there's a good chance it won't fit your specific needs.

some of the out-of-the-box image styles and responsive image styles.
